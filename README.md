# Blog Flutter UI Project

Simple Flutter application displaying, posting and editing blogs.

This project is intended to implement the contents of the course IN307 "Mobile Computing".
Further the Flutter app uses the [Quarkus REST Api Project](https://github.com/getWombats/Hftm_IN306_BlogService) for crud operations of the blog entries.

    ```

- Run:

    ```sh
